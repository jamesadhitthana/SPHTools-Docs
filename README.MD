## Support

I'm sorry if the app or documentation confuses you.
This is a project I created as a favor for a school called Sekolah Pelita Harapan Lippo Village (Karawaci).
Therefore, the source code will not be made public because of [Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule ("COPPA")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act).

For project inquiries, you can contact me. Thank you.
